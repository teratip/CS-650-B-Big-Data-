# 1.Write a program to get the average of 3numbers: 7, 12, and 5
# let the numbers be x , y , z
x <- 7
y <- 12
z <- 5

# Average calculation
average <- (x + y + z) / 3
average

# 2.Write a program to print out “Welcome to R,<your first name>”
# Print the message
greet <-"Welcome to R,"
name <-" Pallavi"
message <- paste(greet, name)
message

# 3.Let x be 7, y be 12 and z be 4, print out whether x is bigger than y and whether x is bigger than z
# The variables
x <- 7
y <- 12
z <- 4

# Print whether x is bigger than y
x > y

# Print whether x is bigger than z
x > z
